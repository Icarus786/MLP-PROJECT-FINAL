# ICC-T20-world-cup-2022-Prediction
In this project , we are trying to predict the outcomes of upcoming ICC T20 world cup 2022 matches using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Goals
* Applying different Machine Learning algorithms for prediction and finding most accurate model.
* Prediction of matches winner of ICC T20 WC 2022.

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data wrangling, feature extraction and outcome prediction.
# Datasets
We have used four datasets i.e. T20Records(for all international T20 matches),T20Fixture(for fixture of ICC T20 WC 2022),T20Ranking(for current T20 ranking) and T20TeamStats(having teams stats in previous World cups).We have referred https://cricsheet.org/ for getting the T20 matches records from 2005 to 2022.For current ranking and WC 2022 we referred Cricbuzz and got the  teams stats for previous World cup from Wikipedia.
# Tools, Software and Libraries
  1. Jupyter Notebook

  2. Numpy

  3. Pandas

  4. Seaborn

  5. Matplotlib

  6. Scikit-learn
 
# Algorithm
We are trying with different algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours model. After trying with all these approaches , we will be comparing the accuracy of all of them and use the best model for prediction.
